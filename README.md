# Readsome2 :fire:
Readsome2 is an update of the older version of <a href="https://github.com/NelloCarotenuto/Readsome">Readsome</a>:
>"an iOS highly-customizable text reader for people affected by dyslexia or for whoever has problems at reading"

The first version of the app has been built in the context of the iOS Foundation Program at the University of Salerno, Italy.
The update consists in the implementation of CloudKit framework to enable the use of iCloud and much more functionalities, on the UI and the UX, on which I'm working on.

Readsome2 is being developed only by me, Fabrizio Sorgente, but the first version has been built by Aniello Carotenuto, Miriam Grasso, Antonio Mazzini, Rosa Russo and me. It also relies on two external packages: <a href="https://github.com/gali8/Tesseract-OCR-iOS">Tesseract-OCR-iOS</a> by gali8 and <a href="https://github.com/skywinder/ActionSheetPicker-3.0">ActionSheetPicker-3.0</a> by skywinder.
Readsome also uses <a href="https://opendyslexic.org">OpenDyslexic</a> and <a href="https://github.com/molotro/TestMe02">TestMe02</a> fonts.
